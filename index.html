			<div ><h2> FIRST TROPHY — THE BEGINNING OF A REIGN 🏆</h2>

			<p>The top portion shows a team bursting with raw, almost uncontrollable excitement. Players in shades of green: symbolizing growth, resilience, and Pakistan’s cricketing soul, are packed together on the podium. Arms are raised, fists clenched, mouths open mid-roar. The trophy is lifted high, shining under stadium lights, as if it’s absorbing every cheer in the air 🏆</p>

			<p>You can feel the noise even though the image is silent, crowds screaming, drums beating, hearts racing 💚 The expressions range from disbelief to pride to pure joy. Some players look skyward, others at the trophy, some at their teammates, each glance telling a story of sacrifice and payoff. Behind them, the branding of the HBL Pakistan Super League 2022 frames the moment, grounding this emotional eruption in history 🏆</p>

			<p>This section feels like the spark, the moment that proved they could do it 💚 #QalandarDilse</p></div>

			<div><h2> SECOND TROPHY — CONFIRMATION, NOT A FLUKE 🏆🏆</h2>

			<p>The second segment elevates the narrative. This is no longer surprise, it’s confidence. The team stands taller, smiles wider, celebrations more composed yet equally electric 💚 The banner boldly declares CHAMPIONS – HBL Pakistan Super League 2023, and the word Champions feels heavier now, as if it carries expectation as well as pride 🏆🏆</p>

			<p>Players raise the trophy again, but this time the body language screams belief. This is a team that knows what winning tastes like and isn’t done eating 💚 Their green jerseys glow against the stadium backdrop, blending tradition with modern professionalism.</p>

			<p>Hands stretch into the air, fingers forming victory signs, faces shining with sweat and satisfaction. Support staff, coaches, and members of the squad blend into one unified mass, no hierarchy, no separation just one family celebrating together 🏆🏆 #QalandarBrothers</p>
			<p>This frame feels like the words: “We’re not done.” 💚</p></div>

			<div><h2> THIRD TROPHY — THE DYNASTY SEALED 🏆🏆🏆</h2>

			<p>The final section is absolute chaos, in the most beautiful way possible. This is celebration at its peak, emotion overflowing beyond control 💚 Someone jumps mid-air, frozen in triumph. Others throw their arms up, screaming, laughing, crying, embracing 🏆🏆🏆.</p>

			<p>The banner now reads HBL Pakistan Super League 2025 – CHAMPIONS, and that single word cements everything that came before it 🏆🏆🏆. This is no longer a team that won, it’s a team that defined an era 💚</p>

			<p>The crowd behind the camera is invisible, but their presence is felt in every wide grin and clenched fist. The green kits dominate the frame like a sea of belief, a reminder of national pride and cricketing heritage 💚 Even the lighting feels warmer here, as if the stadium itself is celebrating with them 🏆🏆🏆.</p>

			<p>This section doesn’t feel like an ending.
			It feels like a legacy snapshot 💚</p></div>
